/* The evaluation order of wake makes two guarantees:
 *   [1] Exactly the effects of straight-line execution are produced.
 *   [2] If value A is needed to evaluate B, A happens before B.
 *
 * This means that the order of effects is only defined if one depends
 * on the value produced by the other. However, there is some subtlety;
 * some effects depend on effects by virtue of being invoked or not.
 *
 * def a = <some-effect>
 * def b = a + 1
 * def c = <some-effect-producing-function-whose-effect-dependings-its-1st-argument> b
 * Clearly, 'c' depends on 'a' and will run after it.
 *
 * def a = <some-effect>
 * def c = if a then <some-effect> else Nil
 * In this case, while the second effect does not directly depend on 'a',
 * it's invocation depends on 'a'; therefore, it will run after it.
 *
 * def a = <some-file-producing-effect>
 * def c = if a then <enumerate-files> else Nil
 * In this case, while 'c' has no effects, the enumeration step must be
 * evaluated after 'a'; therefore, the new files will be detected.
